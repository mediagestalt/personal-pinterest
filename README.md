# Personal-Pinterest

This is a multipart project that downloads your entire Pinterest library for storage in your very own MySQL database, allowing you to create a tagged, searchable archive of your images.

The underlying purpose of this project is to provide a tutorial on personal information management, and curating your own personal Pinterest is a good place to start.

I created this project because I worry about the reliability of cloud based services these days, and Pinterest especially has a little too much sponsored content for my liking. 

This tutorial will introduce you to the following coding skills:

- a tool called [Pinback](http://www.pinback.it/) that will download your Pinterest notebooks to individual `html` files.
- a simple web-scraping [Python script](personal-pinterest.ipynb) that downloads your Pinterest images to your computer.
- a hands-off MySQL tutorial describing the design of my database.
- a very simple `php` web form that allows for data entry *(Iâ€™m a beginner at this)*
- maybe a nicer way to display the data?
